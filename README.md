# SharePoint-ReportPrinter
The Report Printer solution is a SharePoint 2013 application that is used to print the current page this is added to. It adds a "Print", "Add to Favorites", and "Close" button to the page. The navigation, Ribbon, and Site Title are all hidden from the page until the user choses to print.
